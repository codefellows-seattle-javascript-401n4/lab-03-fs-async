# Lab 03 - T.Jay

* Just gonna say - started by setting up all the necessary things (Don't need to list a million bullet points, ya know?)

* I proceeded to build a test, not a great one and I think it is throwing a false positive - but for some reason it passes... I required expect and the printFiles.js file to run, gave it some paths and got it listed and ... I don't know why it works.

* Working with a few of my classmates, they helped me build my code for my index.js and pass through the required arguments... and at this point, the Black Magic and Voodoo that is JS took hold and the test passed, again, no idea why.

* I am going back to the docs.
