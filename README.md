My code creates a module with a function that takes in an array of three file paths and a callback. The module then reads those three files. If there is an error it will pass in an error for the callback, if not it will pass the contents as the data parameter in your callback. Then in index.js I call the function I created with three actual file paths and a callback. If an error is encountered it will throw an error and console.log the error. If successful it will console.log the contents of each file in a string. It then reads the next file calling the same function.
